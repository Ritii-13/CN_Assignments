## Linux Command Line Utilities

### 1. `iconfig` command:
`ifconfig` is used to configure network interfaces in Unix and Linux operating systems. It is used to view and change the configuration of the network interfaces on system. `ipconfig` for Windows.

1. Using `ifconfig` on my device outputs the following:
![ifconfig](<Screenshot 2024-08-21 181158.png>) 
`eth0` is the primary WiFi interface on my device. 
![ifconfig_1](<Screenshot 2024-08-21 181158-1.png>)
The rectangle highlights the `ipv4` address of the `eth0` network interface which is `172.30.159.31`. (Note: I am using the college WiFi)

2. `ifconfig -a` command is used to display all interfaces even if they are down.
![ifconfig-a](<Screenshot 2024-08-21 181238.png>)

3. Now we will down `eth0`using the command `sudo ifconfig eth0 down` and use `ifconfig -a` to check if the interface is down.
![ifconfig_down](<Screenshot 2024-08-21 181336-1.png>)
Notice how `UP, RUNNING` is not displayed for `eth0` anymore.

4. Now we will bring `eth0` back up using the command `sudo ifconfig eth0 up` and use `ifconfig -a` to check if the interface is up.
![ifconfig_up](<Screenshot 2024-08-21 181406-1.png>)
Notice how `UP, RUNNING` is displayed for `eth0` again.

#### An interesting observation: 
Although we brought the `eth0` interface up, the internet connection was not restored.
![no_internet](<Screenshot 2024-08-21 181428.png>)
This is because it takes some time for the connection to be restored and since we brought the interface down we need to restart our WSL to access internet again.

5. We can change the IP address of our interface using the command 
``` bash
sudo ifconfig <interface_name> <new_ip_addr>
```
My current IP address is `172.30.159.31` and I changed it to `192.168.1.10` as shown below:
![ip_change](<Screenshot 2024-08-21 181921.png>)

We can revert back to the original IP address using the same command.
![ip_change1](<Screenshot 2024-08-21 182241.png>)

#### Interesting note: 
The IP address change affects the internet connection and we need to restart our WSL to access the internet again.

6. We can also change the subnet mask of our interface using the command 
``` bash
sudo ifconfig <interface_name> netmask <new_subnet_mask>
```
![netmask](<Screenshot 2024-08-21 184342.png>)

7. We can also change the broadcast address of our interface using the command 
``` bash
sudo ifconfig <interface_name> broadcast <new_broadcast_addr>
```
![broadcast](<Screenshot 2024-08-21 184308.png>)

8. We can also change the Maximum Transmission Unit (MTU) of our interface using the command 
``` bash
sudo ifconfig <interface_name> mtu <new_mtu>
```
![mtu](<Screenshot 2024-08-21 184425.png>)

9. We can use `man ifconfig` to get more information about the `ifconfig`.

### 2. `ping` command:
`ping` or Packet Internet Groper is a network administration utility used to check the connectivity between two devices. It sends an ICMP echo request to a host and waits for an ICMP echo reply.

1. Using `ping` to check the connectivity between my device and `www.google.com`:
![ping](<Screenshot 2024-08-21 185257.png>)
The output shows that the packets are being sent and received successfully with 0% packet loss.

2. Transmitting a specific number of packets using
``` bash
ping -c <number_of_packets> <host>
```
![ping2](<Screenshot 2024-08-21 185329.png>)

3. Setting the time interval between the packets using
``` bash
ping -i <time_interval> <host>
```
![ping3](<Screenshot 2024-08-21 185440.png>)

4. Setting the packet size using
``` bash
ping -s <packet_size> <host>
```
![ping4](<Screenshot 2024-08-21 190925.png>)

5. We can specify the interface to be used for sending the packets using
``` bash
ping -I <interface_name> <host>
```
![ping5](<Screenshot 2024-08-21 191051.png>)

### 3. `traceroute` command:
`traceroute` is used for tracing the full path from your local system to another network system. It shows the number of hops taken to reach the destination and the time taken for each hop.
It sends an order of UDP packets, routes three packets of data to test each hop by default.

1. Using `traceroute` to trace the path to `www.google.com`:
![traceroute](<Screenshot 2024-08-21 191546.png>)
The `* * *` most probably suggest that the specific organization does not want to reveal details of their internal network or there might be an overload.

2. To use ICMP echo requests instead of UDP packets, we can use
``` bash
sudo traceroute -I <host>
```
![traceroute2](<Screenshot 2024-08-21 191850.png>)
An increase in the number of hops giving `* * *` is observed when using ICMP echo requests.

Interestingly, using the command given in the tutorial slides
``` bash
traceroute --type=icmp <host>
```
or 
``` bash
sudo traceroute --type=icmp <host>
```
did not work for my WSL and gave Bad Option.
![traceroute4](<Screenshot 2024-08-21 191955.png>)

3. We can specify the maximum number of hops using
``` bash
traceroute -m <max_hops> <host>
```
![traceroute3](<Screenshot 2024-08-21 191943.png>)

### 4. `netstat` command:
`netstat` or Network Statistics is used to display network connections, routing tables, interface statistics and masquerade connections.

1. Using `netstat` to display the routing table:
![netstat](<Screenshot 2024-08-21 192650.png>)
![netstat2](<Screenshot 2024-08-21 192722.png>)
The routing table shows Protocol, Reference Count, Flags, Type of Service, State (in this case, all `CONNECTED`), I-Node and Path.

2. Using `netstat -a` to display all connections:
![netstat3](<Screenshot 2024-08-21 193112.png>)
![netstat4](<Screenshot 2024-08-21 193126.png>)
`netstat -a` displays all connections and `LISTENING` ports.

3. Using `netstat -t` to display TCP connections:
![netstat5](<Screenshot 2024-08-21 193836.png>) 
Notice how there are no active connections in the TCP table but listening ports are available.

4. Using `netstat -u` to display UDP connections:
![netstat6](<Screenshot 2024-08-21 193953.png>)
Similar to the TCP table, there are no active connections in the UDP table but listening ports are available.

5. Using `netstat -p` to display the process ID of the connections:
![netstat7](<Screenshot 2024-08-21 194123.png>)
![netstat8](<Screenshot 2024-08-21 194241.png>)
![netstat9](<Screenshot 2024-08-21 194634.png>)

6. Using `netstat -r` to display the kernel routing table:
![netstat10](<Screenshot 2024-08-21 195858.png>)
The routing table shows Destination, Gateway, Genmask, Flags, MSS, Window, IRTT and Interface.

7. Using `netstat -i` to display the network interfaces:
![netstat11](<Screenshot 2024-08-21 200313.png>)
The network interfaces table shows Kernel Interface, MTU, Met, RX-OK, RX-ERR, RX-DRP, RX-OVR, TX-OK, TX-ERR, TX-DRP, TX-OVR and Flags.
What this means:
- `RX-OK` is the number of packets received without errors.
- `RX-ERR` is the number of packets received with errors.
- `RX-DRP` is the number of packets dropped.
- `RX-OVR` is the number of packets received but the buffer was full.
- `TX-OK` is the number of packets transmitted without errors.
- `TX-ERR` is the number of packets transmitted with errors.
- `TX-DRP` is the number of packets dropped.
- `TX-OVR` is the number of packets transmitted but the buffer was full.

8. Using `netstat -l` to display only listening ports:
![netstat12](<Screenshot 2024-08-21 200426.png>)
However, using `netstat -a -l` displays all connections and listening ports.
![netstat12](<Screenshot 2024-08-21 200447.png>)
![netstat13](<Screenshot 2024-08-21 200453.png>)

### 5. `nslookup` command:
`nslookup` or Name Server Lookup is used to query the Domain Name System (DNS) to obtain domain name or IP address mapping or other DNS records.

1. Using `nslookup` to query the IP address of `www.google.com`:
![nslookup1](<Screenshot 2024-08-21 204004.png>)
The address changes when we query `nslookup` for `www.google.in`.
![nslookup2](<Screenshot 2024-08-21 204043.png>)

2. Using `nslookup` to query the domain name of `www.github.com`:
![nslookup3](<Screenshot 2024-08-21 204812.png>)
However, doing reverse lookup using the IP address of `www.github.com` does not give the domain name.
So, we try to get an authoritative answer using the command
``` bash
nslookup -type=ns <host>
```
![nslookup4](<Screenshot 2024-08-21 205205.png>)
Now, doing reverse lookup directly on the address still gives no answer. But doing the same using the address name successfully gives the domain name.
![nslookup5](<Screenshot 2024-08-21 205453.png>)

3. We can also  query a specific DNS server using the command
``` bash
nslookup <host> <dns_server>
```
![nslookup6](<Screenshot 2024-08-21 222812.png>)
Here we try to query `www.meta.com` using `8.8.8.8` as the DNS server.

Trying to perform a similar query using `1.1.1.1` as the DNS server gives an error because the DNS server is not reachable.
![nslookup7](<Screenshot 2024-08-21 224558.png>)

### 6. `dig` command:
`dig` or Domain Information Groper is a network administration command-line tool for querying Domain Name System (DNS) name servers, mostly for troubleshooting DNS problems.

1. Using `dig` to query the IP address of `www.google.com`:
![dig1](<Screenshot 2024-08-21 225948.png>).
In the output, we can see the IP address of `www.google.com` and the time taken to query the DNS server, as well as date, message size, flags, query time, server, when the query was received, the answer section, authority section and additional section.
Answer section gives the IP address of `www.google.com`.
Authority section gives the name servers for `google.com`.
Additional section gives the IP address of the name servers.

2. Using `MX` record to query the mail servers of `google.com`:
![dig2](<Screenshot 2024-08-21 230119.png>)
Mail servers are basically the servers that receive and send emails.

3. We can also query a specific DNS server using the command
``` bash
dig @<dns_server> <host>
```
![dig3](<Screenshot 2024-08-21 230319.png>)
This command was used to query `www.twitter.com` using `8.8.8.8` as the DNS server.

#### 7. `netcat` command:
`netcat` is a simple Unix utility that reads and writes data across network connections using the TCP or UDP protocol. It is also known as the TCP/IP swiss army knife. It is like WhatsApp for the command line.
Here is a simple example of me establishing a connection between two terminals on my device using `netcat` in a way that whatever is typed in the first terminal is displayed in the second terminal.
![netcat](<Screenshot 2024-08-23 202300.png>)

#### Overall, 
we were able to learn about the basic Linux command line utilities and their usage. We also learned how to change the IP address, subnet mask, broadcast address and MTU of a network interface using `ifconfig`. We learned how to check the connectivity between two devices using `ping`, trace the path to a network system using `traceroute`, display network connections, routing tables, interface statistics and masquerade connections using `netstat`, query the Domain Name System (DNS) to obtain domain name or IP address mapping or other DNS records using `nslookup` and `dig` and establish a connection between two terminals using `netcat`.
